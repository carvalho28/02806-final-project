            Our fact-checking journey delves into Denmark&apos;s performance
            across key environmental metrics in recent years, emphasizing
            greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions, air
            quality indicators, and the distribution of energy production and
            consumption between renewable and non-renewable sources. Let&apos;s
            examine how Denmark&apos;s efforts have evolved over the past
            quarter-century.

            This visualization reveals a notable decrease in Denmark's
            greenhouse gas emissions over the past 25 years. It's important to
            note that these emissions encompass more than just CO<sub>2</sub>;
            they include any gases that absorb infrared radiation emitted from
            the Earth&apos;s surface, contributing to the greenhouse effect.
            This includes carbon dioxide, methane, and even water vapor, with
            our data covering these gases except for CO<sub>2</sub> from
            biomass.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 font-display text-2xl tracking-tight text-red-900">
            The downward trend in these emissions reflects Denmark's recognition
            of environmental issues and its proactive measures to address them.
            This success marks a significant stride towards cleaner air and a
            sustainable future.

            Decomposing the Emissions
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4 font-display text-2xl tracking-tight text-red-900">
            A deeper look into the emissions reveals that methane, significantly
            influenced by farming and agriculture (40%), fossil fuels (35%), and
            waste (20%), along with CO<sub>2</sub> predominantly from the
            burning of fossil fuels (over 90%), are the primary contributors. By
            reducing reliance on fossil fuels for daily energy needs, Denmark
            has effectively curbed its greenhouse gas emissions.

            These charts show the dramatic transformation in Denmark&apos;s
            energy infrastructure. Over the past twenty years, the share of
            fossil fuels in Denmark&apos;s primary energy sources has nearly
            halvedâ€”a testament to the country&apos;s commitment to
            sustainability. The correlation between the reduction in fossil fuel
            usage and the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions is evident,
            highlighting a major driver behind the positive environmental trends
            observed.

            Exploring the Shift
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-4 font-display text-2xl tracking-tight text-red-900">
            How has Denmark achieved such a substantial reduction in its
            dependency on fossil fuels? Is it a result of decreased overall
            energy consumption, or has there been a significant shift towards
            green energy? These are questions we&apos;ll explore as we analyze
            the changes in how Denmark sources its energy.
